<h1>MEDICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SENIOR CITIZENS</h1>
<h3>under SDG 3.0</h3>
<p>As the global population ages, the need for effective elderly care coordination becomes increasingly critical. Many elderly individuals face challenges in managing their healthcare needs, medication schedules, and daily activities, especially those living independently or in assisted living facilities. The lack of a centralized system for coordinating care services often leads to gaps in care, medication errors, and delayed response to emergencies, impacting the health and well-being of elderly individuals. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive care coordination system to ensure the safety, comfort, and quality of life for the elderly population, aligning with the goal of SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being.</p>
